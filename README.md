Cross - Player movement and animations

I made a 2D platforming, shooter. The player has the ability to move back and forward, jump and shoot. The player has an object in front and below the character. The front one allows the player to shoot and the bottom one allows the player to jump. The player also has an animation for being healed and damaged, glowing green and red respectively. Along with making the camera stay with the player and not go outside the walls.

The code is built so that the player has a direction they are facing so that the player can change the direction they are shooting by moving back and forawrd, when the player collides with the enemy's missiles, or the enemy themselves, the player will shine red from damage and if they collide with a healing orb they will shine green. 

In the next update the enemies will be created and will have animations and actions of their own.
